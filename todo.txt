Set Cmd to use ValueFromRemainingArguments  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_functions_advanced_parameters?view=powershell-5.1#valuefromremainingarguments-argument
 - Maybe not needed.  Managed to improve things in the recent branch 'RevisitArgsLogic'.


Feel like I should test this further and if happy, consolidate the branches back into main :)



Random .md notes:
**What**

Run.exe is a silly tool for overcomplicated environments where an App-V package contains files that aren't used in the launching process.  Consider a bubble for an ActiveX control, or a launch script that resides on a network share, for example.

Instead of figuring out which App-V bubble to launch the process within, Run.exe is added to application install during sequencing, then launching it via Run.exe causes the App-V client to use the appropriate bubble for the IE11 window or whatever the process is...

**How**

The automated application sequencing script creates a GUID directory for the PVAD and copies Run.exe into this as part of the installation.

The assumption is that the App-V entrypoints are suppressed in the deployment configuration .XML files and instead published shortcuts are used...
